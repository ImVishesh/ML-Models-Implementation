📊 Diabetes Patient Classification using Machine Learning 🤖

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I've implemented Stochastic and Batch Gradient Descent Algorithms, L1 & L2 Regularization, Logistic Regression, and Least Square Classification from scratch in Python, all applied to a diabetes patient dataset.

📋 **Project Overview:**
In this project, I've explored the power of machine learning for medical diagnostics. Using a diabetes patient dataset, I've implemented and compared different classification algorithms and regularization techniques to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find in this repository:

🧮 **Key Components:**
1. **Gradient Descent Algorithms**: I've implemented both Stochastic and Batch Gradient Descent from scratch, allowing you to understand the inner workings of these optimization techniques.

2. **Regularization Techniques**: You'll find the code for L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, which helps prevent overfitting and enhances model generalization.

3. **Logistic Regression**: The classic logistic regression algorithm is applied here for binary classification, helping us determine whether a patient has diabetes.

4. **Least Square Classification**: I've also implemented the method, providing an alternative approach to solving the classification problem.

📊 **Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project contains various patient attributes such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc., and a binary outcome indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

🔬 **Why This Project Matters:**
Understanding and predicting diabetes is crucial for early intervention and patient care. This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to medical data, potentially aiding healthcare professionals in diagnosing and managing diabetes.
